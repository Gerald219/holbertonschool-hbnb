# HBnB Project — Diagrams & Documentation

This repo holds the visual documentation for the HBnB system we design at Holberton.

The point of the project is to break the app into three clear layers — frontend/API, business logic, and storage, to show how everything connects. 
**We also mapped out what happens when a user does things like register, post a review, or fetch a list of places.**

## What’s in this repo

Everything’s in one file:  
`part1/6-documentation.md`

Inside that file you’ll find:

- A package diagram that shows the whole system 
- Class diagrams for the key parts of the app: User, Place, Review, Amenity  
- A breakdown of how the classes work and what fields they include  
- Sequence diagrams for four main API calls:
  - User registration  
  - Place creation  
  - Review submission  
  - Getting a list of places

All the diagrams use Mermaid, and every part is explained in plain language.
